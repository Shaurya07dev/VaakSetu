# 📞 AI Calling System Integration Plan

## 🚀 Project Overview

Build a **real-time AI calling system** integrated into a multilingual multi-agent platform (Healthcare, EdTech, Finance) that:

- Handles live phone conversations
- Routes queries to domain-specific agents
- Generates call summaries
- Extracts structured data
- Triggers intelligent follow-ups

---

## 🧠 Core Objectives

- Real-time speech-to-speech interaction
- Multi-agent routing based on intent
- Persistent conversation memory
- Automated summaries & insights
- Follow-up automation system

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

User Call
   ↓
Telephony Provider (Twilio)
   ↓
WebSocket Audio Stream
   ↓
Speech-to-Text (STT)
   ↓
Intent Detection + Agent Router
   ↓
Domain Agent (Healthcare / Finance / EdTech)
   ↓
LLM Response Generation
   ↓
Text-to-Speech (TTS)
   ↓
User

After Call:
Transcript → Summary Engine → Data Extraction → Follow-Up Engine → Scheduler/CRM

---

## 🧩 Core Modules

### 1. Telephony Layer
- Handles inbound/outbound calls
- Streams audio via WebSockets
- Tech: Twilio Voice API

---

### 2. Voice Processing Layer

Pipeline:
Audio → STT → LLM → TTS → Audio Response

- STT: Whisper / Deepgram
- TTS: ElevenLabs / Google TTS
- LLM: GPT-based model

---

### 3. Agent Routing Engine

Logic:
if intent == "health":
    route_to = "healthcare_agent"
elif intent == "finance":
    route_to = "finance_agent"
elif intent == "education":
    route_to = "edtech_agent"

Methods:
- LLM-based intent classification
- Embedding similarity matching

---

### 4. Conversation Memory

Store:
{
  "call_id": "",
  "user_id": "",
  "history": [],
  "intent": "",
  "sentiment": ""
}

Purpose:
- Personalization
- Follow-up intelligence
- Context continuity

---

### 5. Summary Engine

Generate:
- Short summary
- Key highlights
- Action items

Example:
User enquired about personal loan.
Budget: ₹5L
Requested callback tomorrow.

---

### 6. Structured Data Extraction

Output JSON:
{
  "name": "Rahul",
  "intent": "loan inquiry",
  "budget": "₹5 lakh",
  "urgency": "high",
  "next_action": "follow-up"
}

Use:
- LLM function calling / JSON mode

---

### 7. Follow-Up Intelligence Engine 🔥

Core Logic:
if not task_completed:
    schedule_followup_call()

if sentiment == "negative":
    escalate_to_human()

if interest == "high":
    trigger_immediate_followup()

---

### Follow-Up Types

- Reminder Call → Incomplete action
- Sales Follow-up → High interest
- Healthcare → Appointment pending
- EdTech → Course enquiry

---

### 8. Scheduler System

- Handles delayed actions
- Tech:
  - BullMQ (Node.js)
  - Celery (Python)

---

## 🔄 Call Lifecycle

### During Call

1. Call initiated
2. Audio streamed
3. Speech → Text
4. Intent detected
5. Routed to agent
6. Response generated
7. Converted to speech
8. Sent back to user

---

### After Call

1. Save transcript
2. Generate summary
3. Extract structured data
4. Run follow-up logic
5. Store in database

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js / FastAPI
- Voice: Twilio
- AI: OpenAI / LLM
- Queue: Redis + BullMQ
- Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- Storage: AWS S3
- Realtime: WebSockets

---

## 🔗 Website Integration

UI Button:
<button onClick={startCall}>Call AI Assistant</button>

API Flow:
POST /start-call → returns call session

Webhook:
 /api/twilio/voice

---

## 🧠 Advanced Features

- Multi-agent orchestration
- Context-aware calling
- Sentiment detection
- Human handoff

---

## ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions

- Latency → Streaming optimization
- State loss → Session memory
- API sync → Retry + buffering
- Voice lag → Async processing

---

## 📊 Future Enhancements

- WhatsApp follow-ups
- Email automation
- Admin dashboard
- Call analytics
- CRM integration
- Voice cloning

---

## ✅ Deliverables

- Real-time AI calling system
- Multi-agent routing
- Call summaries
- Structured data extraction
- Follow-up automation

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

A fully automated AI call center system that:
- Understands users
- Responds intelligently
- Automates follow-ups
- Improves conversions
